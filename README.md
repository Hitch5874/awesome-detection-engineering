## Concepts & Frameworks 

- [Alerting and Detection Strategies (ADS) Framework | Palantir](https://github.com/palantir/alerting-detection-strategy-framework) - A blueprint for creating and documenting effective detection content.
- [Detection Maturity Level (DML) Model | Ryan Stillions](http://ryanstillions.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-dml-model_21.html) - Defines and describes 8 different levels of an organization's detection program maturity.
- [The Pyramid of Pain | David J Bianco](http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html) - A model used to describe various categorizations of indicator's of compromise and their level of effectiveness in detecting threat actors. 
- [Cyber Kill Chain | Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/what-we-do/aerospace-defense/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html) - Lockheed Martin's framework that outlines the 7 stages commonly observed in a cyber attack.

## Signatures & Content
